# JNC Nina Scraper

Since JNC Nina is dying and will inevitably leave Europe, I'm making the scraper code public. 

It's based on [jncep](https://github.com/gvellut/jncep) for the novel rip part. Then the scrapper will replace every image in the epub with better quality image. The scaper is set to launch every day at 6pm UTC+1. 

### ðŸ’€ If you find this before JNC Nina died, well done !

Fill the .env (create a new file '.env' and use the template provited) and start the docker container. You can upload to mega.io and get a discord notification.
